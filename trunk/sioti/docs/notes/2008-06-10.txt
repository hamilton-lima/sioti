** restart of the project

- removed old classes that use isometric maps 
- removed samples and docs aboutt isometric maps
- removed the physics library - who knows if we use it in the future ...

so the zipped project shirink from 70mb to 50mb :)

- still can remove some libraries from the pulpcore, have to find out
- removed the terra library source code, that was to enable endless terrain,
but I believe that this can be solved in the future, or come with a real simple solution
still have to discuss about this...

- I'm really afraid if this project has future or not ... :)
- the cube is running over the floor, can control it using QWEASD, and Esc to exit

next steps 
- focus on resource management !!
