documentacao em ingles vindo do google code 
----------
This is the main goal of this training game, relying on a 2D RPG game, where the user will build an virtual hero, a series of small pieces of knowledge will be inserted in the flow of activities of the game, allowing the end user to take ownership of the knowledge need for the corporate roles, together with knowledge need for the game roles.

Applying the concept that : everyone want to learn, but just some want to be teach, we expect that by using a fantasy world and a mix of different knowledge, we can set an informal agreement, where the game pretend to don't be educational, and the user pretend to be just playing.

But the truth is that both will know clearly what is being teach and what is being learned, or at least to what kind of knowledge the user was exposed to, by sending reports to the end user of the knowledge exposure, and generating gap analysis reports to the HR teams with the evolution of the percentage of knowledge transfer.

Architecture

based on the concept of keep it simple and small, the following technologies will be used :


2D client - pulpcore 
server side - PHP + mysql
server requests = HTTP calls
server response format = JSON data
